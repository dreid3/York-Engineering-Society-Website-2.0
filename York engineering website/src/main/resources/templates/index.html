	<i2>
	Established in 1910, The Engineering Society of York (ESOY) was originally created to exchange thoughts and ideas on technical articles but quickly grew into an organization which promotes the engineering industry, while also providing support to York County students who wish to pursue a career in engineering. Today the society is comprised of over 100 members who can participate in monthly tours of local companies and lectures delivered by key individuals of the industry and community. Additionally, our members enjoy the annual oyster feed, golf outing, and banquet where sixteen scholarships are awarded to local students working towards a degree in engineering.

	<i2>Our History</i2>
	<p class = "sidebar-text">York County, since its founding, in 1741, has been the home of countless men and women with practical ideas and faith in the progress of our nation. Native sons recall with pride that their forebears were patriots, statesmen, inventors, farmers and craftsmen.
Succeeding generations, having passed on this rich heritage, particularly since the beginning of the twentieth century, give testimony that our South Central Pennsylvania area abounds with persons of superior talents, skills and an intellectual fervor that make for a dynamic America.
